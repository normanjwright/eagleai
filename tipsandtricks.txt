When you start to work with different versions of stuff,
 its best to use a virtual env so you can download from a fresh start rather
  than trying to configure your machine with everything

If you run the following code it will activatte and you should see (eagleaiENV)
  at the start of your terminal lines

  source eagleaiENV/bin/activate


For git commit in a virtual environment, it attempts to call VIM so instead do 
  git commit -m 'MESSAGE'

    
Running the waitlist app:  java -jar waitlist-app-0.6.6.jar
